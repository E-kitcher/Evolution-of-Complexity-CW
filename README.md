This project is about re-implimenting the paper 'Individual Selection for Cooperative Group Formation' by Simon Powers. 
The paper simulates behaviour of 4 different types of individuals. These are cooperative/selfish behaviour combined with small-grouping/large-group perference. It was found (from the given parameters) that cooperative behaviour combined with small-grouping preference was the best strategy.

To further investigate this I extended the model to have time dependant parameters with the purpose of trying to simulate the various seasons. So in mid 'summer' the food resource will be at its highest, and in 'winter' it will be at its lowest. I too found that even with these changes the cooperative + small-grouping individuals are the most fit.

The report explains this in more detail.

The code demonstrates how the results were obtained.
